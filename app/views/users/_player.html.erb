I just realized today that he has unleashed the beast to the public so here it is. Manila Killa claimed he stepped out of his comfort zone for this one but wow is it a gem. He&#8217;s EQed the vocals to compliment the piano beautifully, thrown in some subtle strings, and finally he&#8217;s brought in some trappy drums. MK closes the track with those wonderful strings which just rounds it off really well. The original Bastille isÂ  a classic, however Manila Killa just made this tooo soothing.
