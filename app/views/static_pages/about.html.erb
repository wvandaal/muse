		<p>Muse is an ongoing project that I am designing as part of an assignment for my degree in CS at Trinity College. I am a believer in the maxim that you should only build something that you would actually use yourself, a belief which has led me to create an application that will hopefully help music lovers like myself discover their favorite new tunes.</p>
